# Chirpy Personal AI

Chirpy is a very early prototype of a local conversational voice AI. It has very low response latency, typically less than one second from speech in to speech reply. It also has a one click install, zero external dependencies.

## Install 
The one click install is currently supported only on Windows. An Nvidia GPU with 12GB VRAM is required. [Try it here with one click from the Microsoft Store!](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NC624PBFGB7?hl=en-us&gl=US)

I'd love to get one click installs working for Linux too.

## Development

The codebase is currently in flux. It will probably be difficult to get it running and you may encounter issues. Pull requests are welcome. Thanks for taking a look!
